Please refer to imagine/doc/INSTALL to install the Imagine SDK before building EmuFramework and associated apps

Building EmuFramework
=====================

EmuFramework is built as a static library with the same process as Imagine, see section 3 of imagine/doc/INSTALL

Building Apps Using EmuFramework
================================

With EmuFramework installed into the Imagine SDK, use the makefiles in the app's directory to build a specific port. The final output goes into the build/[port name] directory. For example, to build the Android port with 24 compile jobs, use:

make -f android.mk -j24

This will invoke CMake to build a binary for each architecture (build/android-arm64, build/android-x86_64, etc.) and the combined app in build/android

To build only specific architectures use the make variable android_arch with a space separated list of which architectures to build ("arm64 armv7 x86" for example)
